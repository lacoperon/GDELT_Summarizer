The child's father said his son and his nephew were using the older rifle to shoot at the cans as well when the gun went off.The case has been ruled as an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. While no charges will be filed, the case will go to a Liberty County Grand Jury for review.   © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST "

I'm dying.' Minister recounts chaos during Antioch church shootingThe brazen Sept. 24 shooting left one dead and seven other parishioners seriously injured, Metro police said.Joey Spann and his wife were shot along with fellow parishioners William Jenkins, 83; Marlene Jenkins, 84; and Linda Bush, 68. Katherine Dickerson, 64, was also shot, and Robert ""Caleb"" Engle, 22, who was pistol whipped, were treated at TriStar Skyline Medical Center and released the night of the shooting, hospital officials there said.Melanie Smith, 39, of Smyrna, who was shot as she left the morning church service, died.The shooter, identified as Emanuel Kidega Samson, a 25-year-old Rutherford County man, accidentally shot himself after he was confronted by Engle. Samson was treated at an area hospital and was released into police custody the night of the shooting. He has been charged with one count of criminal homicide and remained jailed Thursday without bond.Additional charges are pending authorities said. He is due in court Friday for a hearing on his case.A note found in Samson's Nissan Xterra referenced retaliation for a white supremacist's massacre at a black church two years ago in Charleston, South Carolina, law enforcement officials told the Associated Press.While police have not released a motive for the attack, the note could offer a glimpse into his mindset.The Associated Press in Washington, D.C. has not viewed the note, but it was summarized in an investigative report circulating among law enforcement.The report said that ""in sum and in no way verbatim,"" the note referenced revenge or retaliation for Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine black worshipers at a South Carolina church in 2015 and has since been sentenced to death.It wasn't clear what Samson, who is black, is alleged to have written about the Roof shooting, or whether his note contained other details that might also speak to a motivation or state of mind.Metro Nashville police have not commented on the note. © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST "

He's a 25-year-old native of Sudan whose Facebook page is populated with gym selfies and bodybuilding poses. He worked as an unarmed security officer and had recently reinstated his license.It remains to be seen how he ended up, as police allege, parked in the church lot as Sunday service was ending. In his possession he had two pistols, a tactical vest and three magazines of ammunition (as well as an empty one); in his car he had an AR-15 rifle in its case and a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. His last Facebook post was at 10:26 a.m., about 30 minutes before he arrived at the church, according to an affidavit.""Everything you've ever doubted or made to be believe as false, is real. & vice versa, B.""Read MoreChurch members knew himSamson is charged with felony homicide and is being held without bond. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.Police say he is accused of killing one woman and injuring seven more in a shooting spree that ended when a church usher intervened. During the altercation, Samson accidentally shot himself in the chest with his own weapon, police said.Police say they are trying to establish his motive. Nashville police said Samson acknowledged opening fire in the church. He also told officers he had attended the church in the past.An usher is hailed as a hero for stopping a church gunmanChurch members confirmed this, telling police he attended the church about two years ago but that they had not seen him in a while. They did not immediately recognize him because the gunman was masked.Some members of the congregation, who declined to give their names because they did not want to speak for the church beyond its official statement, recalled Samson fondly. They said he was friendly to everyone, including one of the people he allegedly shot.He made mysterious Facebook postsSamson's Facebook account offers fragments of the image he created of himself for social media consumption. Church member William Brimm confirmed the account was Samson's.It lists his name, Emanuel K. Samson, and another name he uses, Bulda. It says he is from Khartoum, Sudan and that he went to Smyrna High School in Smyrna, Tennessee, graduating in 2010. It also says he studied psychology at an unspecified community college. CNN has not independently verified these details.Police initially said Samson is from La Vergne, Tennessee, but on his Facebook page he says he lives in nearby Murfreesboro.His languages are Arabic, English and Acholi, according to the page. He lists no political views. ""Your votes mean nothing,"" reads one post. Shooter kills one, wounds 7 at Tennessee churchHis favorite quotes include one from Right Said Fred's 1992 party anthem: ""I'm, so sexy for my shirt ... so sexy, it hurts.""His penultimate quote before the shooting reads, ""Become the creator instead of what's created. Whatever you say goes.""And, before that, at 10:18 a.m.: ""You are more than what they told us.""One quote from his personal description now stands out, though it is not known when it was written.""No need for a life story,"" it says. ""You probably heard about me.""He quit his job as a security guardOn Saturday, the day before the shooting, Samson worked a shift as a security guard for Crimson Security in Nashville, police spokesman Don Aaron said. He sent an email Sunday at 10:01 a.m., within an hour of the shooting, saying he appreciated the opportunity to work but would not be returning.State records indicate Samson had held an unarmed security license between 2014-2016, Nashville police said. It had expired, and Samson had attended a class on Friday to reinstate the unarmed license.He had past encounters with policePolice responded to two domestic calls at a Murfreesboro home involving Samson and his former girlfriend.In January, police responded to an address listed as Samson's home in Murfreesboro. During an argument, Jeanna Ambrose told police that Samson punched her TV and broke a small figurine, according to a police report. They were fighting because he believed she had cheated on him, she told police. As she tried to leave the apartment, he demanded to speak to her and took her phone. She called police from a neighbor's home.Motive sought in deadly Tennessee church shootingIn March, police returned to the same home. Samson told officers he used to date Ambrose and was trying to break off contact with her but she ""keeps coming around,"" according to a police report. He said that, after a brief conversation at the door, she started to get loud and tried to push his door open as he tried to close it. Samson told police that he was in fear because ""she has struck him in the past"" but said she had not threatened or assaulted him that day. Ambrose told police she had come over to pick up some belongings and said she did not threaten or assault him. Officers helped Ambrose retrieve her belongings and told her not to return to the apartment, the report states. Samson was told that he could no longer have contact with her.His next contact with police was on June 27. Murfreesboro Police responded to the home of Samson's father after a 911 call reporting suicidal threats. His father told police that Samson had texted him shortly after midnight saying he had a gun to his head, according to a police report. Samson's father said he tried unsuccessfully to reach his son on the phone and did not know where he was.Police pinged Samson's phone and found him at the Nashville office of security service provider G4S, Nashville Police said Monday. A police officer met Samson at the office, where Samson told him that he was fine and not thinking of harming himself. The officer was satisfied that he was not a danger and left him.CNN's Tina Burnside, Kalenah Arif, Dianne Gallagher and Justin Gamble contributed to this report."

Metro Nashville PD via CNN Accused gunman Emanuel Samson is a 25-year-old native of Sudan whose Facebook page is populated with gym selfies and bodybuilding poses. Related Content Details emerge in Tenn. shooting Church usher hailed as a hero Tenn. church shooter captured (CNN) - As detectives investigate a deadly church shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee, a picture is starting to emerge of accused gunman Emanuel Samson.He's a 25-year-old native of Sudan whose Facebook page is populated with gym selfies and bodybuilding poses. He worked as an unarmed security officer and had recently reinstated his license.It remains to be seen how he ended up, as police allege, parked in the church lot as Sunday service was ending. In his possession he had two pistols, a tactical vest and three magazines of ammunition (as well as an empty one); in his car he had an AR-15 rifle in its case and a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol.His last Facebook post was at 10:26 a.m., about 30 minutes before he arrived at the church, according to an affidavit.""Everything you've ever doubted or made to be believe as false, is real. & vice versa, B."" Church members knew him Samson is charged with felony homicide and is being held without bond. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Police say he is accused of killing one woman and injuring seven more in a shooting spree that ended when a church usher intervened. During the altercation, Samson accidentally shot himself in the chest with his own weapon, police said. Police say they are trying to establish his motive. Nashville police said Samson acknowledged opening fire in the church. He also told officers he had attended the church in the past. Church members confirmed this, telling police he attended the church about two years ago but that they had not seen him in a while. They did not immediately recognize him because the gunman was masked. Some members of the congregation, who declined to give their names because they did not want to speak for the church beyond its official statement, recalled Samson fondly. They said he was friendly to everyone, including one of the people he allegedly shot. He made mysterious Facebook posts Samson's Facebook account offers fragments of the image he created of himself for social media consumption. Church member William Brimm confirmed the account was Samson's. It lists his name, Emanuel K. Samson, and another name he uses, Bulda. It says he is from Khartoum, Sudan and that he went to Smyrna High School in Smyrna, Tennessee, graduating in 2010. It also says he studied psychology at an unspecified community college. CNN has not independently verified these details. Police initially said Samson is from La Vergne, Tennessee, but on his Facebook page he says he lives in nearby Murfreesboro. His languages are Arabic, English and Acholi, according to the page. He lists no political views. ""Your votes mean nothing,"" reads one post. His favorite quotes include one from Right Said Fred's 1992 party anthem: ""I'm, so sexy for my shirt ... so sexy, it hurts."" His penultimate quote before the shooting reads, ""Become the creator instead of what's created. Whatever you say goes."" And, before that, at 10:18 a.m.: ""You are more than what they told us."" One quote from his personal description now stands out, though it is not known when it was written. ""No need for a life story,"" it says. ""You probably heard about me."" He quit his job as a security guard On Saturday, the day before the shooting, Samson worked a shift as a security guard for Crimson Security in Nashville, police spokesman Don Aaron said. He sent an email Sunday at 10:01 a.m., within an hour of the shooting, saying he appreciated the opportunity to work but would not be returning. State records indicate Samson had held an unarmed security license between 2014-2016, Nashville police said. It had expired, and Samson had attended a class on Friday to reinstate the unarmed license. He had past encounters with police Police responded to two domestic calls at a Murfreesboro home involving Samson and his former girlfriend. In January, police responded to an address listed as Samson's home in Murfreesboro. During an argument, Jeanna Ambrose told police that Samson punched her TV and broke a small figurine, according to a police report. They were fighting because he believed she had cheated on him, she told police. As she tried to leave the apartment, he demanded to speak to her and took her phone. She called police from a neighbor's home. In March, police returned to the same home. Samson told officers he used to date Ambrose and was trying to break off contact with her but she ""keeps coming around,"" according to a police report. He said that, after a brief conversation at the door, she started to get loud and tried to push his door open as he tried to close it. Samson told police that he was in fear because ""she has struck him in the past"" but said she had not threatened or assaulted him that day. Ambrose told police she had come over to pick up some belongings and said she did not threaten or assault him. Officers helped Ambrose retrieve her belongings and told her not to return to the apartment, the report states. Samson was told that he could no longer have contact with her. His next contact with police was on June 27. Murfreesboro Police responded to the home of Samson's father after a 911 call reporting suicidal threats. His father told police that Samson had texted him shortly after midnight saying he had a gun to his head, according to a police report. Samson's father said he tried unsuccessfully to reach his son on the phone and did not know where he was. Police pinged Samson's phone and found him at the Nashville office of security service provider G4S, Nashville Police said Monday. A police officer met Samson at the office, where Samson told him that he was fine and not thinking of harming himself. The officer was satisfied that he was not a danger and left him. "

Garcia-Zarate speaks Spanish, and it was not always clear in the police interview whether he understood the questions he was asked or whether he was able to respond clearly.Police also ignored Garcia-Zarate's repeated attempts to invoke his right to silence and ultimately used aggressive interrogation tactics to coerce a 5 a.m. confession from an exhausted defendant, defense attorneys argued.However Assistant District Attorney Allison Macbeth said that while Garcia-Zarate repeatedly said he did not want to answer questions, he then demanded to be allowed to sign a confession, made other contradictory statements and continued talking to officers.""The defendant's confession was voluntary,"" Macbeth said. ""Loud and aggressive techniques in themselves were not sufficient to render it involuntary.""Judge Samuel Feng allowed the entire statement to police to be admitted but excluded a statement made by Garcia-Zarate to an ABC7 reporter in an on-camera interview just days after the shooting.In that statement Garcia-Zarate also admits to shooting Steinle but describes the shooting as an accident, saying he found the gun and it went off when he picked it up.Matt Gonzalez, chief attorney for the public defender's office, said the statement Garcia-Zarate ultimately made to police was full of factual inaccuracies. He told police he shot Steinle from 5 feet away when it was actually 90 feet, and said he walked past her as she lay injured on the ground when evidence shows that was not the case, Gonzalez said.The statement to ABC7, which was not made under duress, would have helped to illustrate those issues, but its exclusion will not prevent the defense from making its case that the shooting was accidental, Gonzalez said. Physical evidence from the scene shows that the bullet that struck Steinle ricocheted off the ground more than 75 feet away from her.""We just can't get around the fact that he fired the gun pointed at the ground and basically missed her from 78 feet,"" Gonzalez said. ""It ricocheted off the ground and hit her in the lower back. But for this freak accident that no firearms expert could repeat we wouldn't be here.""Steinle's shooting created a national controversy after it was revealed that Garcia-Zarate, an undocumented immigrant, had been released from San Francisco county jails months before the shooting after a marijuana charge was dismissed despite a civil detainer request by immigration authorities.Under its longstanding Sanctuary City policies and in accordance with legal precedents, San Francisco does not honor most such requests unless they come in the form of a criminal arrest warrant.The gun in the shooting was also found to have been stolen from a Bureau of Land Management agent's car in San Francisco, prompting state legislation requiring law enforcement to secure weapons stored in vehicles. Garcia-Zarate has not been linked to the vehicle burglary by prosecutors or police. "

""The real heroes are the police, first responders and medical staff and doctors who have helped me and everyone affected.”He also asked for people to pray for those who were affected by the shooting.""I ask everyone to pray for the victims, family members of the victims, our church community. Please pray for healing,” Engle said in another statement. “Also, please pray for the shooter, the shooter’s family and friends. They are hurting as well.”One witness, Minerva Rosa, said the situation could have been worse if Engle had not intervened.""He's amazing,"" Rosa told reporters on Sunday. ""Without him, I think it could be worse. He was the hero today.""Rosa, who has been a member of the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ for eight years, said the suspect was silent as he fired shots inside the church. She said she heard the pastor shout ""Run! Run! Gunshots!"" as the gunman made his way down the aisle.Engle's grandmother, 69-year-old Rheta Engle, told a local newspaper that she was proud of him.""That’s like him. He’s just someone who cares about a lot of people. He has all their feelings at heart,"" she told the Tennessean on Sunday afternoon. ""It would make any parent, grandparent very, very proud of him.""Blake Langford, Robert Engle's friend, described him as a “gentle giant.”“He's just a great guy,” Langford told the Tennessean. “Just one of the kindest human beings you'll ever meet.”Robert Engle was released from a local hospital on Sunday night and is back home with his family, according to local news outlets.Samson, who police said had attended the church within the past two years, was treated at a local hospital for a gunshot wound and is expected to be charged with one count of murder, with additional charges pending, according to police.The motive for the shooting is unclear.The Memphis FBI Field Office's Nashville Resident Agency, the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee have opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting.Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.
